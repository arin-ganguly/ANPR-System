# ANPR-System
This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using Python and OpenCV. 
The system detects vehicle license plates in images or video streams and recognizes the alphanumeric characters on them. 
Such systems are instrumental in traffic monitoring, toll collection, and security enforcement.

üìå Features
Real-time license plate detection using Haar Cascade classifiers.

Character segmentation and recognition using OpenCV.

Outputs processed video with annotated license plates.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
The current Haar Cascade classifier may not detect all license plate formats, especially non-standard or obscured plates.

Recognition accuracy may decrease under poor lighting or low-resolution conditions.

The system primarily supports license plates similar to the training data of the Haar Cascade used.
